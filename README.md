# ReactGame
Guessing/Memory game application
Instead of flipping over cards and remembering where their match is the user clicks on individual cards, the cards are reshuffled, and then the user must remember which cards they previously clicked on. This game takes advantage of React's ability to manage state.

How it Works

Click the images one at a time.

The images shuffle after each click.

High score and current score are stored as state data and displayed live.

Click the same image more than once, and you lose!

How does the app work?
The app uses the react for the UI.

The data is stored as component state data.

The app is hosted on Heroku.
